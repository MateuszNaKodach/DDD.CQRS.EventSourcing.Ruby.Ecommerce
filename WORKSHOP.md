To ensure maximum use of the time during the workshop, please set up the project before it.
We use Makefile to make the setup simple. However, if you run into a problem
during setup, please reach us so we can help you set it up before the workshop.

1. Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:RailsEventStore/ecommerce.git`
2. `cd ecommerce`
3. run `make install`
4. run `make dev` - the app should be up and running. Take a look around
5. run `make test` to make sure the tests are running. Tests will be important
part of the workshop
6. Take a look at `README.md`. It explains how the app is structured and the goal
of this repository

See you at the workshop ðŸ‘‹
